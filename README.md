# collab-cards

Collab Cards is (or will be) something in between email, wikis and blog posts.

Imagine if everyone in your company/group had a single place to store every gist, every 'how-to', every 'great writeup' recommendation?

Collab-Cards plans on giving you just that. A list of 'Cards' with short, digestable contents for agile knowledge sharing.

## Cool! How did you guys come up with this?
This was proposed as an open source project during a developer meeting on STI-UFF during a talk about better communication between different teams, as our millions of emails about 'Cool stuff, look at this' kept being ignored and were hard to find afterwards.

## So, when will this be complete?
Hopefully it will evolve eternally and thus, never be complete, but we are still at the planning stages of this project. Want to help? Check out our issues and send us a pull request!
